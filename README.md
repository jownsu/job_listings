# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering solution

This is a solution to the [Job listings with filtering challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Screenshot

It is my pleasure to share with you a screenshot of my solution to the job-listings challenge. I have invested considerable time and effort into developing a clean, user-friendly interface that is designed to streamline the job application process. The job listings are displayed in a clear and concise manner, with important details such as job title, company name, and location prominently displayed. I have also implemented filters that allow users to narrow their search based on specific criteria, such as job type or location. Overall, I believe that my solution represents a significant step forward in the world of job listings, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.
